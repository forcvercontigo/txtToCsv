Temperaturescould climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part ofthe morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expirationthe market had pretty much dried up.""Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the mainreason for the decline in spot market prices.Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to theNew York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per millionBritish thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. SinceMonday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecastsindicated reduced utility load requirements.In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies theynormally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weatherforecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the$67.00-$75.00 range.

Natural gas prices were a large factor in recentelectricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-firedgeneration to meet increased weather-related demand.Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an averageof 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million Britishthermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an averageof 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've gotpeople coming to their senses,"" one trader said.

11,"Liane,As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt tomanipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a singlebuyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid abovemarket prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades,offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices werebypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the indexcalculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associatedfinancial swaps for San Juan.We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed fromSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades fromEnron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokeragefirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for atrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gasdaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greaterthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September andOctober gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices thatare dramatically different.I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, thetrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able todetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades areoutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid inestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from thecalculation of index.It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which toconduct our physical and financial business.

13,"Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?

28,"Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austinthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.

41,"Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><invest@bga.com>I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lotduplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a muchlower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are dueto a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one ofthe duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sqfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought hissales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sellfor $203,108.What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) therent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if wewere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroomunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.Sincerely,George W.

Exodus is now wrapping upconstructionon a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less thana mile from itsoriginal facility. Sitting at the confluence of severalfiber optic backbones, theExodus plant will consume enough power for a small town andeventuallyhouse Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,Microsoft and Onvia.com.Exodus is not the only company building massive datacenters near Seattle.More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,Globix andHostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will housethe networkingequipment of the Internet economy.It is a big business that could have an effect oneverything from yourmonthly electric bill to the ease with which you accessyour favorite Web sites.Data centers, also known as co-location facilities andserver farms, aresprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the KentValley that somehave expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light andPuget SoundEnergy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,high-securityfacilities.""We are talking to about half a dozen customers thatare requesting 445megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,""said KarlKarzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget SoundEnergy. ""That isthe equivalent of six oil refineries.""A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,the rise of the Internetdata center has some utility veterans scratching theirheads.Puget Sound Energy last week asked the WashingtonUtilities andTransportation Commission to accept a tariff on the newdata centers. Thetariff is designed to protect the company's existingresidential and businesscustomers from footing the bill for the new base stationsnecessary to supportthe projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20million each,Karzmar said.Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans tobring up the data centerissue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.For the utilities that provide power to homes,businesses and schools in theregion, this is a new and complex issue.On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazingappetite for power --represent potentially lucrative business customers. Thefacilities run 24 hours aday, seven days a week, and therefore could become aconstant revenuestream. On the other hand, they require so much energy thatthey couldpotentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capitalexpenditures.Who will pay for those expenditures and what it willmean for power ratesin the area is still open to debate.""These facilities are what we call extremely denseloads,"" said Bob Royer,director of communications and public affairs at SeattleCity Light.""The entire University of Washington, from stadiumlights at the footballgame to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.We have datacenter projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40and 50 megawatts.""With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergatecomplex in Tukwila isone of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchasedthe 1.35 millionsquare-foot Intergate East facility last September fromBoeing Space &Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased92 percent of thesix-building complex to seven different co-locationcompanies.""It is probably the largest data center park in thecountry,"" boasts LaurentPoole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICGCommunications,NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and ZamaNetworks alllease space in the office park.After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997,Sabey has become anexpert in the arena and now has facilities either undermanagement ordevelopment in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Pooleclaims his firm isone of the top four builders of Internet data centers inthe country.As more people access the Internet and conductbandwidth-heavy taskssuch as listening to online music, Poole said the need forco-location space inSeattle continues to escalate.But it is not just Seattle. The need for data centerspace is growing at arapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,causing similarconcerns among utilities in places such as Texas andCalifornia.Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-locationspace, plans to nearlydouble the amount of space it has by the end of the year.While companiessuch as Amazon.com run their own server farms, manyhigh-tech companieshave decided to outsource the operations to companies suchas Exodus thatmay be better prepared for dealing with Internet trafficmanagement.""We have 2 million square feet of space underconstruction and we plan todouble our size in the next nine months , yet there is moredemand right nowthan data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an accountexecutive at Exodus inSeattle.The booming market for co-location space has left somein the local utilityindustry perplexed.""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to doto serve the growth,""said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry isalmost stunned by this, ina way."""

150,"It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  TheWSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposesthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, butthere can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual""generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule theirgeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then youwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern californiamunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simplyschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having saidall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives onthe generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  Whilethey don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number isbetter than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on theload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this withothers up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gasdemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,especially compared to all gas consumption.

160,"Phillip--I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strangeto me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not bean issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this isO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me toget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know andI'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygatecurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of$235,019.(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change youroverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affectssomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)GDP-Kingsgate.Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see fivedifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be forwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as aQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means isthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transportlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have asystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seemsthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's thedetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where itappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may bean operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollarimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just incase there's something you want to do about it.

171,"Laird DyerMike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning.  They were polite regardingasset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing tolisten to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges toprotect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentialityagreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enableus to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholdervalue by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and byreducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via aweather product.As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue othercandidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategyto ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate ouropportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as weimplement our strategy in California.Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an assetmanagement deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend tosystematically identify and work through all the candidates.Laird"
172,"Laird,Did you meet with SWG on April 27th.  Are there any other asset managementtargets in the west?Jane M TholtAM ---------------------------Laird DyerJanie,Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th todiscuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like togain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What aretypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your maincontacts at SW Gas?We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving ourcontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probablyhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with thecommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from theircommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of monthindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  Thatrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation oftheir PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatlyappreciated.Thanks,Laird"

Any possibility for adeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicansand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus isreportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans andDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once thebonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" intothe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature andthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details ofthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-termpower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that thebond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach ofcontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridgeloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be verydifficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the statewould ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the GeneralFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even thisconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for fulldisclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including thedetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before theywill support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This billpassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack ofRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs forcommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may beamended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state shouldget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would belikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to moneyavailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has statedthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  TheRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary andthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.Key Points of the Bridge FinancingLehman Brothers  $1.0 BBear Stearns  $625 MTax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current ProjectedFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create theCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billionauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must beauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or theadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasingpower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of theseauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts thegovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bondamount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay tosupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paidfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. forthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this canbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting thisidea  earlier in the crisis.SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  Thefirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and thegovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU isAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  Accordingto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal hassigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davisand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicatesthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntarybankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bondissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, thestate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included andpassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file forbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities andthe DWR proportionately from rate payments."

287,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holdingthe business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal businessmeetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip iseven desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to tryand stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is workingand what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quietjust waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in around table discussion format.My suggestion for where to go is Austin.

304,"Ray Alvarez@ENRONPhil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closeddoors ""in smoke filled rooms"", if not directly between Commissioners thenamong FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely thatthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in largepart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at whichthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairmanbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment oranswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert hadPrice caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reducedemand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they wouldexport California's problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a prettystrong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissionerout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda andif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off theagenda.  Hope this info helps.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demandover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting fortemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translatesinto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) ascompared with the previous year.Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntaryreductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Otherforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (makingtotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couplemore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to theretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that itis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to lastyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa inJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservationare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood ofmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the generaleconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at leastmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control areaonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISOportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions indemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  Asyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminumsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off atleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets itswish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Severalmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they aresharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactlyhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif'seconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest ofthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, Ithink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% alreadyrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in thenon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for theWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide youwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, Ihope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have anyquestions or need any further information."

354,"Reagan,I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA221(d) loans?Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment2%- overhead4%- profitI just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached anextremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see evenreducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would onlygenerate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled aboutsuch a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost downto $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.

359,no problem
360,"Reagan,Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp lessand cost about the same?2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factoryjoist?3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  Whattype of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass orCellulose?5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't knowthe difference between an apron and a stool.7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to preventcracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partialone out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath underthe stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermountstainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Ironrailings?15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price exceptfor change orders?I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision butthis is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going tocall Cary Kipp tosee about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.PhillipI"

366,"Greg,Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf(rentable)What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2%overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.Why is profit only 4%?Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit toboost loan amount but not a real cost?Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Whoreceives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope putsNOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40%expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.

They probably planned forthe students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.Phillip"
371,keith holst sent you an email with the details.
372,"Jacques,The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry mightobject to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance theconstruction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costsof the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered theloan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount ofequity that would be required.Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items arein a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speakingdirectly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear onwhat is the best way to proceed with these consultants.The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do weneed to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  andgive consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.Phillip"

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British ColumbiaHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwestregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paidabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.But that still wasn't enough juice.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawattsof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawattsof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the$250/MWh price cap.The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. Themunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess powerinto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWPis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suitclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal BonnevillePower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into themarket at prices 10 times higher.Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying alltransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the stateno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is havingto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willingto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday duringa conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergencyWednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declaredwhen the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power isinterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only asa means of attracting additional electricity resources.""In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,""Dorinson said.Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energyunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost ofthe high-priced power.SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to highwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow bynearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retailcustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricityrates or if companies will absorb the costs.-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncPwr Plant(This article was originally published Wednesday)LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California IndependentSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke EnergyCorp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the statesince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for thereasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to theISO.The ISO manages grid reliability.As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alertat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state woulddip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid gridcollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rollingblackouts.The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),Reliant Energy Inc.

(DYN) saidWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped bysome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimatereasons.The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's powergrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California PublicUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all powerplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW forunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergencyfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% andcustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may becalled on to do so.As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesdayevening.Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AESand Dynegy Tuesday evening.AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspectionof the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesdaymorning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman AaronThomas said.Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representativesreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions CreditsThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities haveused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken downtwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air QualityManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,Thomas said.AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entireHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitosand Redondo Beach plants.The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AEShas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine thecompany $20 million for polluting.""We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,""Thomas said. ""It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air qualitydistrict's"" authority.As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AEScould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its offline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUCDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesdayevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off lineWednesday.""I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if youneed to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'"" said Dynegyspokesman Lynn Lednicky.Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance andthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which couldpose a safety hazard if not repaired.""We've been doing all we can to get back in service,"" Lednicky said. ""Weeven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.""Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation ofwhy its units were off line.-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

It looks as if we will be able touse everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey,appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 inextensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land likeearnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and Ididn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clearthis up.Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership andthe risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.

389,"Please respond to aod@newsdata.comFYI Western Price Survey ContactsCal-ISO's declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggeredin part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to ceasehour-to-hour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meetbiological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so inorder to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it hadbeen telling California's Department of Water Resources that thesales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today thanyesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California becauseof concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sendingexchange energy into California, however.More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of theWestern Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter."

Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lotand is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed atopographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun tocoordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on thesmaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is goingto fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged tocomplete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which$14,000 are due now for work completed.We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred bythe original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we cancontinue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo'snumber is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly andask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your calland he was fine with that.Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by KippFlores can be used.Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.

404,"Andrew M OzunaGeorge,Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for theSagewoodPhase II project.  Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forwardon the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on aBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjustedpro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we areacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about500+units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,this,we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a seriouseffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requestedloan amount to $8,868,000.Pro-Forma                           Bank's AdjustmentUnit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $4753 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $4172.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unitturn over.3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can supportdebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25xdebtcoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.6.

Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC)willbe in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within theacceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-formaperformance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my creditofficer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officersigning off on the deal.3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developersdeferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget asdeferred profit has been acceptable.Thanks,Andrew OzunaReal Estate Loan Officer210-271-8386##"

Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS,TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all theparties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS andTAGG but the issues facingscheduling in Unify are grey.2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up""policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals needfurther      scrutiny.3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physicalimbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design trainingcourses, review progress and make cuts.5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking ateverything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should addsome value and direction to the group.In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MDto work part time to get it done.Phillip"

443,"Jaques,After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have differentdefinitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of asuperintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to thirdparty subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management""fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would bepaid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finallythe builders profit of 1.4 million.Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers outof the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, ifthey are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in additionto the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have beenin the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates andthe superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction managementfee is included.George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I willreview and let you know what I think.The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable tothe 3 out 4 approval process.Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  onlytrue costs + 1.4 million.Phillip"

468,"Jacques,Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting asolid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutescosts.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and Iwould like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to faxall invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to thechecking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearingbut invoices were not being submitted.Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need sometweaking.Phillip Allen713-853-7041pallen@enron.com"

473,"Jeff,My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take asales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still onlyrequire $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, Iwould net around $20K cash.You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 orhigher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give theNew Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.Phillip"
474,"Jeff,I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are severalreasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, thelarge cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyerare the three biggest concerns.What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over thebuyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come dueuntil September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold theproperty.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to makethe deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinanceis pushing too far.Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day theearnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the NewBraunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will getstarted on the list.Email or call  me later today.Phillip"

483,"George,The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shiftedto a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I couldnot work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning moretowards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  Onewing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage +guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  Thisplan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with thecourtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoorliving.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglassskylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to havesingle slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I wouldlike to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, Iwould like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  Iwould like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one wedidn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan.Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work)Phillip AllenPS.  Channel 2 in Houston ran a story yesterday (Feb. 2) about a home inKingwood that had a poisonous strain of mold growing in the walls.

485,Nice.  how much?Are you trying to keep the economy going?
486,Testing.  Sell low and buy hightesting
487,"Jeff,Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance andrepairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra laborcost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent onrepairs.2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsitemanager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager hasinterest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male managerthat could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to amanagement company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manageronsite.3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If youwant to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structurethis deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This propertydefinitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.Sales Price  705,0001st Lien   473,5002nd Lien  225,000Transfer fee    7,500Cash required   14,500NOI   100,0001st Lien    47,2922nd Lien   23,694Cash flow  29,014Cash on cash  200%These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K thencash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect theadditional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few yearsfor a higher price.Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.Phillip"

Cash NeedsSCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=plete=20cash depletion date of February 1, 2001.

The actual cash flow, given these cash=20conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.II. Credit RelationshipsSCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20extend or renew credit as it has become due.At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=lt.=20Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=nd=20payable.SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond==20indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =its=20rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade==20issues within the last three weeks.III. Energy Cost ScenariosHighlightsThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=such=20scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.IV.

Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20Activity)As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s==20Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=e=20end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit==20balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20D.01-01-018.Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20expressed in the TRA, are overstated.TURN ProposalAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=RN=20to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=s.=20The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=t=20would not directly generate nor use cash.The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=ift=20costs between two regulatory assets.TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=the=20revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =in=20the TRA is overstated.VI. Flow of Funds AnalysisIn the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a==20positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to==20its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its==20shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=on=20stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=ve=20and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.[there is no Section VII]=20VIII.

496,"George,Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and buildersprofit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would berecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 wouldbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as theinvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentionedearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you aspart of the construction contract.Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit fromhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase1 complete in November)+5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule-5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, butcould be as favorable as 55/45.

509,"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City StarAs natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York MercantileExchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gasstorage number.The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and theforecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated asupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights.""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson,a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas.""But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American GasAssociation's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled thestorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view thenumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker thanreality.""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand whatwe are reporting,"" McGill said.As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons --and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointingfingers at Wall Street.Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recentlystepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators forthe rise in gas prices.""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adiktold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly.In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electricutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blamefor this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect theircustomers and constituents from such price spikes.Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to takeprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of priceinsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gasprices before they soared.""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said PaulSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers.""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs tochange,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy SecurityAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass.Hot topicmany circles, little else is discussed.The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City isfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double theprevious December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills aswell.The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part ofhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financialpledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating.""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said.A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 perthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhileto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid bycustomers.But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousandcubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storagefor winter.There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November,prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy InformationAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heatingbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gasmarkets.""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis.Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New Yorktraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatilecommodity in the world.Setting the priceIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price ofgas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began tradingcontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon hadwidespread influence over gas prices.The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soonas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in saleprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, fromutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in whatthey pay for the gas they expect to use.There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intentionof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledgeof natural gas.But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need toknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like allfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds totheir volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of moneyin a short time.As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was lessthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10.Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association'sweekly storage numbers.Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect toneed in the winter.Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less thanaverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, inhopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would besufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, theconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storagenumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said theassociation's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage.But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vicepresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap hadcontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.""I was getting worried,"" he said.Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer.Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures pricesdropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.Just passing throughSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase butpass their fuel costs on to customers.Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gascharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri GasEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said lastmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little couldbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserveenergy.Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected tosave an average customer about $25 this winter.Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek anextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would notguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have leftcustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whetherthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuelcosts.On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the PublicCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission toperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices.""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said.

527,"George,Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and buildersprofit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would berecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 wouldbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as theinvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentionedearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you aspart of the construction contract.Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit fromhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase1 complete in November)+5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule-5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, butcould be as favorable as 55/45.

532,"Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser.  Note that theconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than ourstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratioof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costsare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we haveactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psfwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairlysure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3bedroom.

In attendance were Ken Lay,the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and hisideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of nextweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based onmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials JeffDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding ourproposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situationwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoingcommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities togo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than whatthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has morework to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  Hetalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retaillevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for thebenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which hewould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market orientedsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fixthe problem by '02 and provide some political cover.included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemedinterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting agoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilitiesto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rateanalysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issuesincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gaspurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to findingsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" ofgeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers thatthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  Thiswas a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plusbasis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation inCalifornia.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would morewidely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west foraddtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plantmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service atany one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hearmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should beable to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We madesome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buysome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generationthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and controlapproach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.thoughts and get them to Kari)He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of thedeal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of theforward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today."

545,"Steve,I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  Ifyou need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards salesabove monthly index without enough consideration of futurereplacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should beinjected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.This creates a shortage in later months.2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meetdemand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in orderto fill storage?2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away toomuch gas from Socal's system.I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting theirown demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas thantheir injection capablity, but injected far less.3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to shortterm prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the majorLDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floatingrate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers marketand theconsumer has benefitted.Call me if you need any more input.Phillip"

598,"Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.
